This is a web app which allows a user to generate simple CSS code for gradient backgrounds.

### Usage

On page load, the app will apply a gradient background with randomly selected colors in hex value format. More random backgrounds can be created by clicking on the 'Random' button or by refreshing the page.

The user can also select specific colors to use by clicking on either of the color picker buttons. The background will be updated in real-time as the user interacts with the color picker widget.

The angle of the gradient can also be cycled by clicking the 'Change Angle' button. This will rotate the angle by 45 degs on each button press.

CSS code for the currently displayed background will be shown at the bottom of the page.
